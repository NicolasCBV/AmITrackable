# HELLO THERE
## ABOUT
This is a simple project made in my weekend, I was trying to put more in practices some knowledge about some features used in legacy systems, and as a conclusion, I made a simple system that tracks a bunch of information about user and says for them, what is being exposed on the internet.

To use this app in your own environment, build the application with "npm run build" and start the server with "npm run dev".
