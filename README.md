# HELLO THERE
## ABOUT
This is a simple project I made over the weekend. I was trying to study some legacy features, and as a conclusion, I made a simple system that tracks a bunch of information about users and tells them what is being exposed on the internet.

To use this app in your own environment, build the application with ```npm run build``` and start the server with ```npm run dev```.

## WATCH OUT
All your geographic data will be exposed on your screen when you enter this website, PAY ATTENTION on what you are doing! So if you are recording it, stay warned!
